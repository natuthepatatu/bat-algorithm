# bat-algorithm
Evolutionary computation algorithm called Bat algorithm + test functions animation of the algorithm work

# Short decription
Updated code by https://github.com/buma/BatAlgorithm, added test functions animations and main code for running tests. In order to view animations, set variable `showanimation = True` and in the init file uncomment `yield`.
